The Multi Choice Knapsack problem (referred to as MCKP) is a generalisation of the ordinary knapsack problem, where the set of items in partitioned into different classes. The problem consists of finding exactly one item per class in order to maximize the total gain while respecting a total capacity constraint.

Multiple approaches are possible, both to the exact and relaxed problem. The solver implements 5 different approaches to the problem :
